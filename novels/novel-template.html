                <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: The Ruins</h2>
                <p>The sun hung low over the horizon, casting long shadows across the crumbling skyscrapers. Maya had walked these streets a thousand times before, yet each visit felt like entering a tomb for the first time.</p>
                <p>The city was silent. Not the peaceful silence of nature, but the eerie silence of abandonment—the absence of life where there once was abundance. Glass shards crunched beneath her boots as she navigated through the broken remnants of civilization.</p>
                <p>"Still nothing?" a crackling voice came through her headset.</p>
                <p>"Still nothing," Maya confirmed, her breath forming small clouds in the cold air. "But I'm getting close. I can feel it."</p>
                <p>She had been searching for three years. Three years of following fragments, decoding old records, and piecing together the puzzle of what happened to the world. And now, finally, she believed she was close to the truth.</p>

                <h3>A Sound in the Darkness</h3>
                <p>As night fell completely, Maya took shelter in one of the old buildings. The structure was still relatively intact—a former apartment complex where families once lived, laughed, and dreamed. Now it was just another monument to the past.</p>
                <p>She was setting up her camp when she heard it: a sound, faint but unmistakable. A sound that didn't belong to the wind or the settling of old concrete.</p>
                <p>It was a voice.</p>

                <div class="chapter-divider"></div>

                <p>"Hello?" Maya called out, her hand instinctively moving to the flashlight at her belt. "Is anyone there?"</p>
                <p>For a long moment, there was only silence. Then, from somewhere in the depths of the building, came a reply.</p>
                <p>"I... yes. Please... is someone there?"</p>
                <p>Maya's heart raced. In three years of exploration, she had found no signs of life. No other survivors. And now, in this moment, she realized that everything was about to change.</p>

                <p>She stood up, steadied her nerves, and began to climb the stairs toward the voice. Whatever waited for her at the top, whatever answers—or new questions—lay ahead, she was ready.</p>
                <p>The last city was about to reveal its secrets.</p>

                <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 2: The Survivor</h2>
                <p>The figure that emerged from the shadows was younger than Maya expected—a girl, barely out of her teens, with dark eyes that held both fear and curiosity.</p>
                <p>"My name is Maya," she said slowly, keeping her distance. "I won't hurt you."</p>
                <p>The girl's lips trembled. "I'm... I'm Eli. I've been alone for so long... I thought everyone was gone."</p>
                <p>As Eli's story unfolded, Maya began to understand. There were others. Hidden. Protected. Waiting for someone like her to find them.</p>
                <p>And with that realization came a new mission—not just to understand the past, but to secure a future.</p>
